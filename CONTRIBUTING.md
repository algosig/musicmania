This was my Third Semester Project where Ashesh, Biki and two other members combinedly worked hard to create this project.
Although at this date this seems pretty basic but during third semester to come up with a Music Upload Downloading project witt
Administration and all stuffs was kind of big achievement for us.

So specially for the starter who is pondering at PHP it is a good place to find out what a weird coder we guys were and how many redundant codes we had written :)
